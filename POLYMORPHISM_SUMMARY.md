# Polymorphism Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed and Implemented

### 1. **Abstract Base Class Design**
- Created `ChessPiece` as an abstract base class
- Defined abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses:
  - `isValidMove(Position newPosition)` - Each piece validates its own moves
  - `getPossibleMoves()` - Each piece calculates its own possible moves
  - `getSymbol()` - Each piece has its own symbol representation

### 2. **Concrete Implementations**
- **Bishop**: Implements diagonal movement logic
- **Knight**: Implements L-shaped movement logic
- Both classes demonstrate method overriding and polymorphic behavior

### 3. **Polymorphism Demonstrations**

#### **Runtime Polymorphism**
```java
// Same method call, different behavior based on actual object type
ChessPiece piece1 = new Bishop(...);
ChessPiece piece2 = new Knight(...);

// Both can be called the same way, but behave differently
piece1.isValidMove(position); // Uses Bishop's diagonal logic
piece2.isValidMove(position); // Uses Knight's L-shape logic
```

#### **Uniform Treatment**
```java
// All pieces can be treated uniformly through the ChessPiece interface
ChessPiece[] pieces = {bishop, knight, rook, queen};
for (ChessPiece piece : pieces) {
    Position[] moves = piece.getPossibleMoves(); // Each piece knows its own moves
    String symbol = piece.getSymbol(); // Each piece has its own symbol
}
```

#### **Type Identification**
```java
// Runtime type checking for piece-specific methods
if (piece instanceof Bishop) {
    Bishop bishop = (Bishop) piece;
    bishop.canAttack(targetPosition); // Bishop-specific method
}
```

### 4. **Key Polymorphism Benefits Demonstrated**

1. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new piece types (Queen, Rook, Pawn, King)
2. **Maintainability**: Common behavior defined once in base class
3. **Flexibility**: Different pieces, same interface
4. **Code Reuse**: ChessBoard works with any ChessPiece subclass

### 5. **Fixed Polymorphism Errors**

- **Method Overriding**: Properly implemented abstract methods in subclasses
- **Type Safety**: Used instanceof for safe type casting
- **Interface Consistency**: All pieces implement the same interface
- **Runtime Resolution**: Methods are resolved at runtime based on actual object type

### 6. **Project Structure**

### 7. **How to Run**
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `compile_and_run.bat` or manually:
   ```bash
   cd oopShayTavor\ex2
   javac *.java
   cd ..\..
   java oopShayTavor.ex2.ChessGame
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

This implementation demonstrates:
- ✅ Abstract class design
- ✅ Method overriding
- ✅ Runtime polymorphism
- ✅ Interface-based programming
- ✅ Type identification and casting
- ✅ Extensible object-oriented design

The code is ready for GitHub upload and demonstrates proper Java polymorphism concepts!
